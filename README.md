## **Movie Ticket Management System using DBMS and XAMPP â€“ Description**

The **Movie Ticket Management System using DBMS and XAMPP** is a web-based application designed to manage movie ticket bookings efficiently through a database-driven backend. This system simplifies the process of selecting movies, choosing seats, and booking tickets by storing and retrieving data using a **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** like **MySQL**, which is run through **XAMPP**, a popular local server environment.

The system automates ticket booking for users and streamlines the operations for cinema administrators by handling large volumes of data related to users, movies, schedules, and seat availability.
